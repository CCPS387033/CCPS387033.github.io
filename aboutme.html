                                <p>I am working on being a successful businessman. By starting my own clothing line and hopefully making a lot of money doing it. Some experiences that led me to are, my brother started his own line, and he did very well, and I also helped him a lot so I know what to do and how to achieve my goal.
I am working towards my goal by getting a lot of help because I can’t do everything by myself. Also, I’m coming up with a whole bunch of designs and symbols to represent the brand. So therefore, I know how to make sure I become successful.
I value a lot of things. For example, I think in order to be successful you need to be very hardworking, and you need a lot of dedication. So, if I do just that in my opinion, I know I will succeed in the long run.
My short-term goals are to take things step by step and not rush into things so I can make sure I know what I am doing. So that means I will focus on one thing for a longer time than usual because I feel like if I do that then I will be just fine.
. I want to be known for my hard work and my dedication because starting a clothing brand isn’t for everyone.</p>
